## Overview

This project uses a four-forty 12S BMS board and a particle photon as a BMS for a 12S lithium ion battery. Included in the project are the following features:

 - isolation of low from high voltage systems
 - web connectivity (not fully implemented but hardware supported)
 - current measuring
 - cell level voltage monitoring
 - low and high voltage cutoff
 - 30A maximum current rating (depends on relay used)
